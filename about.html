            <h3>
                 Since beginning my journey as a designer/developer and graduating from Austin Coding Academy, I have been able to collaborate with many talented people to help create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious and perpetually working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.
        
                Front-end Development is my passion. I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser. As a designer I value simple content structure, clean design patterns and thoughtful interactions.
            
                Develop what you need.
                I'm a developer, so I know how to create your website to run across devices using the latest technologies available.</h3>
